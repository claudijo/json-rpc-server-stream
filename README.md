# JSON RPC Server Stream

JSON 2.0 RPC Server implementation with streaming I/O and event driven API for
endpoint implementers. For the corresponding client implementation see
[json-rpc-client-stream](https://github.com/claudijo/json-rpc-client-stream)

## JSON RPC 2.0 Architecture

The [JSON RPC 2.0 protocol](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) uses a
client-server-architecture, in contrast to the peer-to-peer oriented 1.0
version, where peers act as both clients and server. However, it is still
possible to use JSON RPC 2.0 in a peer-to-peer fashion.

### Using JSON RPC 2.0 in a Peer-to-peer Fashion

A server and client pair must be installed on each node in order to use JSON RPC
2.0 in a peer-to-peer fashion. Additionally, the communication channel between
nodes must be bi-directional, for instance using
[WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API).
The problem with such a setup is to distinguish between incoming requests from
incoming responses.

This could be handled by the protocol implementation, since it is quite easy to
distinguish well-formed requests from responses. Consequently, messages could be
inspected by the implementation and either be handled as requests or as
responses. However, such an approach is not optimal â€“ It violates the idea of
_separation of concerns_. Furthermore, there are malformed JSON RPC 2.0
messages, such as an empty array `"[]"`, that cannot be distinguished as a
malformed request that requires an error response or a malformed response that
should be left unanswered.

A better approach when a JSON RPC 2.0 server and client on the same node share a
common bi-directional channel is to multiplex and demultiplex (mux/demux) the
transmission, so each message only hits the intended endpoint implementation.
The module [mux-demux-stream](https://github.com/claudijo/mux-demux-stream) can
be used to achieve this.

## Usage

Create a streaming JSON RPC server and add event listeners for incoming
requests (and notifications).

As mentioned above, it is also recommended to pipe the streaming JSON RPC 2.0
server through a mux/demux before piping it to a channel stream, if using both a
client and a server on the same endpoint that share a bi-directional channel.

### jsonRpcServerStream()

The module exports a factory function that returns a JSON RPC server stream
instance, which is a [duplex stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_duplex).

### jsonRpcServerStreamInstance.rpc.on(event, listener)

Add listener for an rpc method. The listener takes a `parameter` argument and a
`reply` argument. The reply argument is a callback that should be called with an
error and a result if the rpc was a request. If the reply callback is provided
with an error, the result argument must be left undefined. If the rpc was a
notification (which should not be replied to) the reply callback is a noop.

## Basic Example

The following examples shows the basic use cases for a JSON RPC 2.0 Server.

```js
var jsonRpcServerStream = require('json-rpc-server-stream');

// A request
jsonRpcServerStream.rpc.on('divide', function(params, reply) {
  if (params.denominator === 0) {
    return reply(new Error('Division by zero'));
  }

  reply(null, params.numerator / params.denominator);
});

// A notification
jsonRpcServerStream.rpc.on('logToConsole', function(params) {
  console.log(params);
});

getSomeReadableStreamSomehow().pipe(jsonRpcServerStream).pipe(getWritableStreamSomehow());
```

## Advanced Example

The following example show how to implement a JSON RPC 2.0 client and server
in the browser where WebSockets are used as a shared bi-directional channel,
with multiplexed and demultiplexed transmission. Additional modules
[json-rpc-client-stream](https://github.com/claudijo/json-rpc-client-stream),
[ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws),
[websocket-connection-stream](https://github.com/claudijo/websocket-connection-stream),
and [mux-demux-stream](https://github.com/claudijo/mux-demux-stream) are used.

```js

var WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server;
var wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });
var mux = require('mux-demux-stream').mux;
var demux = require('mux-demux-stream').demux;

wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
  var websocketConnectionStream = require('websocket-connection-stream')().attach(ws);
  var jsonRpcServerStream = require('json-rpc-server-stream')();
  var jsonRpcClientStream = require('json-rpc-client-stream')();

  // Multiplex outgoing client requests and outgoing server responses.
  mux([jsonRpcServerStream, jsonRpcClientStream], websocketConnectionStream);

  // Demultiplex incoming server requests and incoming client responses
  demux(websocketConnectionStream, [jsonRpcServerStream, jsonRpcClientStream]);


  jsonRpcServerStream.rpc.on('join', function(params, reply) {
    if (checkIfUserIsAllowedToJoinRoomSomehow()) {
      placeJsonRpcClientStreamInARoomCollectionSomehow(params.roomId, jsonRpcClientStream);
      return reply(null, 'OK';
    }

    reply(new Error('Not allowed'));
  });

  jsonRpcServerStream.rpc.on('chat', function(params) {
    var jsonRpcClientStreams = getAllJsonRpcClientInstancesForRoomSomehow(params.to);

    jsonRpcClientStreams.forEach(function(jsonRpcClientStream) {
      jsonRpcClientStream.rpc.emit('chat', { from: params.from, message: params.message });
    });
  });

});

```
